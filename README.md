# Tic Tac Toe

### Abstract:
I built an application that allows users to play a tic tac toe game. The game increases as players win and the game is then reset. A game can either end in a draw or either player winning. The game displays who's turn it is when playing. This app is trying to solve the problem of boredem, why be bored when you can hop online and play a tic tac toe game with a friend!

### Learning Goals:
- Understanding the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Understanding how to write code using the data model first concept.
- Writing classes and learning how to use new instances of classes as global variables.
- Understanding how to reflect the data model to the DOM.
- Understanding flexbox and how that is used to align items on a page. 
- Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to match a provided comp.
- Using multiple classes to build out an aplication. 

### Wins + Challenges:

##### Wins: 
- Working with CSS and using flexbox felt really good and like a big win!
- Class to class felt really good and that is another big win!

##### Challenges
- Getting food poising during this project!
- My reset method is just not corporating, I tried multiple things and it broke my code several times. I    know I need to use the setTimeout method to get it to time lapse but It wont even clear on it's own. I am really sad about this but I gave it my best shot!
